In this folder I will be documenting my process in solving the problem of creating a 
game of rock paper scissors. 

Link to the project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

Outline (Console Version):
    1) Create a Git Repo for this project

    2) Create a blank HTML document

    3) Make a function called getComputerChoice() 
        i) This function will randomly return either Rock, Paper or Scissors

    4) Write a function that plays a single round of RPS - let's call it playRound()
        i) Takes 2 parameters (playerSelection & computerSelection) 
        ii) Returns a string that declares the winner and/or loser

    5) Create game() function
        i) Put the playRound() function inside this function
        ii) Make it play a best-of-5 game and keep score
    

The process (Console Version): 
    * My first step is to ask questions *

        Inputs?
            - User's selection (prompt(playerSelection))

            - Computer's selection (getComputerChoice() outputs ---> computerSelection)

        Outputs?
            - Introduction with rules (a simple console.log("...") with a timed delay)
